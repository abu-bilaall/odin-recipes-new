    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, or more as needed</li>
        <li>10 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season heavily with salt and pepper, on the outside and inside the cavity. 
            Stuff the cavity with 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter and thyme sprigs. Squeeze 1/2 lemon into the cavity and drop lemon half inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rub the remaining 1/4 cup butter underneath the skin. Rub the skin with 1 tablespoon olive oil or additional melted butter. 
            Place chicken on a wire rack in a roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake chicken, uncovered, in the preheated oven until an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken 
            reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
